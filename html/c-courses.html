            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Introduction</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell
                Laboratories of AT&T Labs. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX
                operating system.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aqua;"><br><br>▣ The main features of the C language include :<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>General Purpose and Portable</li>
                <li>procedural Programming language</li>
                <li>Low-level Memory Access</li>
                <li>Fast Speed</li>
                <li>Clean Syntax</li>
            </ul>


            <p><br>These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or
                compiler development.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Why Should We Learn C ?</p>
            <p><br>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language like
                the syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages that are mainly based on the C language.
                C++
                is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).<br>So, if a
                person learns C programming first, it will help them to learn any modern programming language as well.
                Also, learning C helps to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system like
                pointers, working with memory locations, etc.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Variables</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>In C, variable is a name given to the memory location to easily store data and access it when required.
                It allows us to use the memory without having to memorize the exact memory address. A variable name can
                be used anywhere as a substitute in place of the value it stores.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Create Variables :</p>
            <p><br>To create a variable in C, we have to specify its name and the type of data it is going to store.
                This is called variable declaration.We can also create multiple variables of same in a single statement
                by
                separating them using comma.C provides a set of different data type that are able to store almost all
                kind of data. For example, integers are stored as int type, decimal numbers are stored by float and
                double data types, characters are stored as char data type.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Rules for Naming Variables :</p>
            <p><br>We can assign any name to the variable as long as it follows the following rules:<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>A variable name must only contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.</li>
                <li>A variable name must start with an alphabet or an underscore only. It cannot start with a digit.
                </li>
                <li>No white space is allowed within the variable name.</li>
                <li>A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword.</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Initialization & Updating :</p>
            <p><br>No useful data is stored inside a variable that is just declared. We have to initialize it to store
                some meaningful value to the variable. It is done using assignment "operator = ".<br><br>We can also
                update
                the value of a variable with new value whenever needed by using the assignment "operator = ".</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Constants :</p>
            <p><br>We know that we can change the value stored by any variable anytime, but C also provides some
                variables whose value cannot be changed. These variables are called constants and are created simply by
                prefixing
                "const" keyword in variable declaration.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Data Types</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>Each variable in C has an associated data type. It specifies the type of data that the variable can store
                like integer, character, floating, double, etc.</p>
            <p><br>C is a statically type language where each variable’s type must be specified at the declaration and
                once specified, it cannot be changed. This is because each data type requires different amounts of
                memory and
                allows type specific operations.</p>

            <p><br><br>In this article, we will discuss the basic (primary) data types in C.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Integer Data Type</p>
            <p><br>The integer datatype in C is used to store the integer numbers (any number including positive,
                negative and zero without decimal part). Octal values, hexadecimal values, and decimal values can also
                be stored
                in int data type in C.<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</li>
                <li>Size: 4 bytes</li>
                <li>Format Specifier: %d</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>The integer data type can also be used as:<br><br></p>
            <ol>
                <li>unsigned int: It can store the data values from zero to positive numbers, but it can’t store
                    negative values
                </li>
                <li>short int: It is lesser in size than the int by 2 bytes so can only store values from -32,768 to
                    32,767.</li>
                <li>long int: Larger version of the int datatype so can store values greater than int.</li>
                <li>unsigned short int: Similar in relationship with short int as unsigned int with int.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Character Data Type</p>
            <p><br>Character data type allows its variable to store only a single character. The size of the character
                is 1 byte. It is the most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte
                of
                memory in almost all compilers.<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Range: (-128 to 127) or (0 to 255)</li>
                <li>Size: 1 byte</li>
                <li>Format Specifier: %c</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Float Data Type</p>
            <p><br>In C programming, float data type is used to store single precision floating-point values. These
                values are decimal and exponential numbers.<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Range: 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38</li>
                <li>Size: 4 bytes</li>
                <li>Format Specifier: %f</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Double Data Type</p>
            <p><br>The double data type in C is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with
                double precision. It can easily accommodate about 16 to 17 digits after or before a decimal
                point.<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Range: 1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308</li>
                <li>Size: 8 bytes</li>
                <li>Format Specifier: %lf</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Void Data Type</p>
            <p><br>The void data type in C is used to indicate the absence of a value. Variables of void data type are
                not allowed. It can only be used for pointers and function return type and parameters.<br>Void function
                means it doesn’t return any value.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Input and Output</p>
            <div class="line"></div>


            <p>In C programming, input and output operations refer to reading data from external sources and writing
                data to external destinations outside the program. C provides a standard set of functions to handle
                input from the user and output to the screen or to files. These functions are part of the standard
                input/output library "stdio.h".<br>In C, there are many functions used for input and output in different
                situations but the most commonly used functions for Input/Output are scanf() and printf() respectively.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Standard Output Function – printf ( )</p>
            <p><br>The printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stdout (which is
                generally the console screen). It is one of the most commonly used functions in C.<br><br>Syntax :
                printf(“formatted_string”, variables/values);</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Standard Input Function – scanf ( )</p>
            <p><br>scanf () is used to read user input from the console. It takes the format string and the addresses of
                the
                variables where the input will be stored.<br><br>Syntax : scanf(“formatted_string”,
                address_of_variables/values);<br><br>Remember that this function takes the address of the arguments
                where the read value is to be stored.</p>

            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Operators</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>In C language, operators are symbols that represent some kind of operations to be performed. They are the
                basic components of the C programming. In this article, we will learn about all the operators in C with
                examples.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ What is an Operator in C ?</p>
            <p><br>A C operator can be defined as the symbol that helps us to perform some specific mathematical,
                relational, bitwise, conditional, or logical computations on values and variables. The values and
                variables used with operators are called operands. So, we can say that the operators are the symbols
                that perform operations on operands.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Types of Operators in C</p>
            <p><br>C language provides a wide range of built in operators that can be classified into 6 types based on
                their functionality. <br>The main 4 operators are:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>1. Arithmetic Operators : </p>
            <p><br>The arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands.<br>There
                are 9 arithmetic operators in C language:</p>

            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>In C, programs can choose which part of the code to execute based on some condition. This ability is
                called decision making and the statements used for it are called conditional statements. These
                statements evaluate one or more conditions and make the decision whether to execute a block of code or
                not.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Types of Conditional Statements in C</p>
            <p><br>There are many different types of conditional statements available in C language:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>1. if in C : </p>
            <p><br>The if statement is the simplest decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain
                statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block
                of statements is executed otherwise not.<br>A condition is any expression that evaluates to either a
                true or false (or values convertible to true or flase).<br><br>The expression inside () parenthesis is
                the
                condition and set of statements inside {} braces is its body. If the condition is true, only then the
                body will be executed.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>2. if-else in C : </p>
            <p><br>The ifstatement alone tells us that if a condition is true, it will execute a block of statements and
                if
                the condition is false, it won’t. But what if we want to do something else when the condition is false?
                Here comes the C elsestatement. We can use the elsestatement with the ifstatement to execute a block of
                code when the condition is false. The if-else statement consists of two blocks, one for false expression
                and one for true expression.<br><br>The block of code following the else statement is executed as the
                condition present in the if statement is false.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>3. Nested if-else in C : </p>
            <p><br>A nested if in C is an if statement that is the target of another if statement. Nested if statements
                mean an if statement inside another if statement. Yes, C allow us to nested if statements within if
                statements, i.e, we can place an if statement inside another if statement.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>4. if-else-if Ladder in C : </p>
            <p><br>The if else if statements are used when the user has to decide among multiple options. The C if
                statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true,
                the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the C else-if ladder is bypassed. If
                none of the conditions is true, then the final else statement will be executed. if-else-if ladder is
                similar to the switch statement.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>5. switch Statement in C : </p>
            <p><br>The switch case statement is an alternative to the if else if ladder that can be used to execute the
                conditional code based on the value of the variable specified in the switch statement. The switch block
                consists of cases to be executed based on the value of the switch variable.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>6. Conditional Operator in C : </p>
            <p><br>The conditional operator is used to add conditional code in our program. It is similar to the if-else
                statement. It is also known as the ternary operator as it works on three operands.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>7. Jump Statements in C : </p>
            <p><br>These statements are used in C for the unconditional flow of control throughout the functions in a
                program. They support four types of jump statements:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color:yellowgreen"><br><br>A) break : </p>
            <p><br>This loop control statement is used to terminate the loop. As soon as the break statement is
                encountered
                from within a loop, the loop iterations stop there, and control returns from the loop immediately to the
                first statement after the loop.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color:yellowgreen;"><br><br>B) continue : </p>
            <p><br>This loop control statement is just like the break statement. The continue statement is opposite to
                that of the break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of
                the loop.
                As the name suggests the continue statement forces the loop to continue or execute the next iteration.
                When the continue statement is executed in the loop, the code inside the loop following the continue
                statement will be skipped and the next iteration of the loop will begin.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color:yellowgreen;"><br><br>C) goto : </p>
            <p><br>The goto statement in C also referred to as the unconditional jump statement can be used to jump from
                one point to another within a function.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color:yellowgreen;"><br><br>D) return : </p>
            <p><br>The return in C returns the flow of the execution to the function from where it is called. This
                statement does not mandatorily need any conditional statements. As soon as the statement is executed,
                the flow of the program stops immediately and returns the control from where it was called. The return
                statement may or may not return anything for a void function, but for a non-void function, a return
                value must be returned.</p>

            <div class="line"></div>

            <P>In C programming, there is often a need for repeating the same part of the code multiple times. For
                example, to print a text three times, we have to use printf() three times. vBut if we say to write this
                20 times, it will take some time to write statement. Now imagine writing it 100 or 1000 times. Then it
                becomes a really hectic task to write same statements again and again. To solve such kind of problems,
                we have loops in programming languages.</P>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ What are loops in C ?</p>
            <p><br>Loops in C programming are used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met. It
                allows
                programmers to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times without writing the code again
                and again.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Types of Loops in C</p>
            <p><br>There are 3 looping statements in C:<br><br></p>
            <ol>
                <li>for Loop</li>
                <li>while Loop</li>
                <li>do-while Loop</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ for Loop</p>
            <p><br>for loop in C programming is a repetition control structure that allows programmers to write a loop
                that will
                be executed a specific number of times. It enables programmers to perform n number of repetitions in a
                single line. for loop is entry-controlled loop, which means that the condition is checked before the
                loop’s body executes.</p>

                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>The various parts of the for loop are:<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Initialization: Initialize the variable to some initial value.</li>
                <li>Test Condition: This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of
                    the loop is executed. If evaluated false, loop is terminated.</li>
                <li>Update Expression: After the execution loop’s body, this expression increments/decrements the loop
                    variable by some value.</li>
                <li>Body of Loop: Statements to repeat. Generally enclosed inside {} braces.</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ while Loop</p>
            <p><br>A while loop is a block of code to perform repeated task till given condition is true. When condition
                become false it terminates. while loop is also an entry-controlled loop in which the condition is
                checked before entering the body.</p>

            <p><br>Syntax : <br>while (condition) {<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Body of the loop<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp }</p>

            <p><br>Only the condition is the part of while loop syntax, we have to initialize and update loop variable
                manually.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ do-while Loop</p>
            <p><br>The do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but the difference is that do-while loop tests
                condition after entering the body at the end. do-while loop is exit-controlled loop, which means that
                the condition is checked after executing the loop body. Due to this, the loop body will execute at least
                once irrespective of the test condition.</p>

            <p><br>Syntax :<br>do {<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Body of the loop<br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp} while (condition);</p>

            <p><br>Like while loop, only the condition is the part of do while loop syntax, we have to do the
                initialization
                and updating of loop variable manually.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Nested Loops</p>
            <p><br>Nesting loops means placing one loop inside another. The inner loop runs fully for each iteration of
                the outer
                loop. This technique is helpful when you need to perform multiple iterations within each cycle of a
                larger loop, like when working with a two-dimensional array or performing tasks that require multiple
                levels of iteration.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Loop Control Statements</p>
            <p><br>Loop control statements in C programming are used to change execution from its normal sequence.</p>

            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Functions</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>A function in C is a set of statements that when called perform some specific tasks. It is the basic
                building block of a C program that provides modularity and code reusability. The programming statements
                of a function are enclosed within { } braces, having certain meanings and performing certain operations.
                They are also called subroutines or procedures in other languages.<br>In this article, we will learn
                about functions, function definition. declaration, arguments and parameters, return values, and many
                more.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Syntax of Functions in C</p>
            <p><br>The syntax of function can be divided into 3 aspects:<br></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Function Declaration</li>
                <li>Function Definition</li>
                <li>Function Calls</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Function Declarations</p>
            <p><br>In a function declaration, we must provide the function name, its return type, and the number and
                type of
                its parameters. A function declaration tells the compiler that there is a function with the given name
                defined somewhere else in the program.</p>
            <p><br>Syntax: return_type name_of_the_function (parameter_1, parameter_2);</p>
            <p><br>The parameter name is not mandatory while declaring functions. We can also declare the function
                without
                using the name of the data variables.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Function Definition</p>
            <p><br>The function definition consists of actual statements which are executed when the function is called
                (i.e. when the program control comes to the function).<br>A C function is generally defined and declared
                in a single step because the function definition always starts with the function declaration so we do
                not need to declare it explicitly.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Function Call</p>
            <p><br>A function call is a statement that instructs the compiler to execute the function. We use the
                function name and parameters in the function call.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Function Return Type</p>
            <p><br>Function return type tells what type of value is returned after all function is executed. When we
                don’t want to return a value, we can use the void data type.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Function Arguments</p>
            <p><br>Function Arguments (also known as Function Parameters) are the data that is passed to a function.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Conditions of Return Types and Arguments</p>
            <p><br>In C programming language, functions can be called either with or without arguments and might return
                values. They may or might not return values to the calling functions.<br><br></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Function with no arguments and no return value</li>
                <li>Function with no arguments and with return value</li>
                <li>Function with argument and with no return value</li>
                <li>Function with arguments and with return value</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Types of Functions</p>
            <p><br>There are two types of functions in C:<br><br></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Library Functions</li>
                <li>User Defined Functions</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>1. Library Function : </p>
            <p><br>A library function is also referred to as a “built-in function”. A compiler package already exists
                that contains these functions, each of which has a specific meaning and is included in the package.
                Built-in functions have the advantage of being directly usable without being defined, whereas
                user-defined functions must be declared and defined before being used.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>Advantages of C library functions : <br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>C Library functions are easy to use and optimized for better performance.</li>
                <li>C library functions save a lot of time i.e, function development time.</li>
                <li>C library functions are convenient as they always work.</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>2. User Defined Function :</p>
            <p><br>Functions that the programmer creates are known as User-Defined functions or “tailor-made functions”.
                User-defined functions can be improved and modified according to the need of the programmer. Whenever we
                write a function that is case-specific and is not defined in any header file, we need to declare and
                define our own functions according to the syntax.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>Advantages of User-Defined Functions :<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changeable functions can be modified as per need.</li>
                <li>The Code of these functions is reusable in other programs.</li>
                <li>These functions are easy to understand, debug and maintain.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Passing Parameters to Functions</p>
            <p><br>The data passed when the function is being invoked is known as the Actual parameters. In the below
                program, 10 and 30 are known as actual parameters. Formal Parameters are the variable and the data type
                as mentioned in the function declaration. In the below program, a and b are known as formal parameters.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>We can pass arguments to the C function in two ways:<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pass by Value</li>
                <li>Pass by Reference</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>1. Pass by Value:</p>
            <p><br>Parameter passing in this method copies values from actual parameters into formal function
                parameters. As
                a result, any changes made inside the functions do not reflect in the caller’s parameters. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>2. Pass by Reference:</p>
            <p><br>The caller’s actual parameters and the function’s actual parameters refer to the same locations, so
                any
                changes made inside the function are reflected in the caller’s actual parameters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Recursion</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Recursion is the process of a function calling itself repeatedly till the given condition is satisfied. A
                function that calls itself directly or indirectly is called a recursive function and such kind of
                function calls are called recursive calls.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Recursive Functions</p>
            <p><br>In C, a function that calls itself is called Recursive Function. The recursive functions contain a
                call
                to themselves somewhere in the function body. Moreover, such functions can contain multiple recursive
                calls.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Recursion Case</p>
            <p><br>The recursion case refers to the recursive call present in the recursive function. It decides what
                type
                of recursion will occur and how the problem will be divided into smaller subproblems. </p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Base Condition</p>
            <p><br>The base condition specifies when the recursion is going to terminate. It is the condition that
                determines the exit point of the recursion. It is important to define the base condition before the
                recursive case otherwise, the base condition may never encounter and recursion might continue till
                infinity</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Memory Management in Recursion</p>
            <p><br>Like other functions, the data of a recursive function is stored in stack memory as a stack frame.
                This
                stack frame is removed once the function returns a value. In recursion,</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The function call occurs before returning a value, so the stack frames for each recursive call are
                    placed on top of the existing stack frames in memory.</li>
                <li>Once the topmost function returns a value, its stack frame is removed, and control is passed back to
                    the function just before it, resuming execution after the point where the recursive call was made.
                </li>
                <li>The compiler uses an instruction pointer to keep track of the location to return to after the
                    function execution is complete.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Stack Overflow</p>
            <p><br>The program’s call stack has limited memory assigned to it by the operating system and is generally
                enough for program execution. But if we have a recursive function that goes on for infinite times,
                sooner or later, the memory will be exhausted, and no more data can be stored. This is called stack
                overflow. In other words,</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Types of Recursions in C</p>
            <p><br>In C, recursion can be classified into different types based on what kind of recursive case is
                present. These types are:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>1) Direct Recursion<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Head Recursion</li>
                <li>Tail Recursion</li>
                <li>Tree Recursion</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>1) Indirect Recursion<br><br></p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>1. Direct Recursion</p>
            <p><br>Direct recursion is the most common type of recursion, where a function calls itself directly within
                its
                own body. The recursive call can occur once or multiple times within the function due to which we can
                further classify the direct recursion</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>A. Head Recursion<br><br></p>
            <p>The head recursion is a linear recursion where the position of its only recursive call is at the start of
                the function. It is generally the first statement in the function.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>B. Tail Recursion<br><br></p>
            <p>The tail recursion is also a liner recursion like head recursion, but the position of the recursive call
                is at the end of the function. Due to this, the tail recursion can be optimized to minimize the stack
                memory usage. This process is called Tail Call Optimization.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px;"><br>C. Tree Recursion<br><br></p>
            <p>In tree recursion, there are multiple recursive calls present in the body of the function. Due to this,
                while tracing the program flow, it makes a tree-like structure, hence the name Tree Recursion.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>2. Indirect Recursion</p>
            <p><br>Indirect recursion is an interesting form of recursion where a function calls another function, which
                eventually calls the first function or any other function in the chain, leading to a cycle of function
                calls. In other words, the functions are mutually recursive. This type of recursion involves multiple
                functions collaborating to solve a problem.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Applications of Recursion in C</p>
            <P><br>Recursion is widely used to solve different kinds of problems from simple ones like printing linked
                lists
                to being extensively used in AI. Some of the common uses of recursion are:<br><br></P>

        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Array</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>An array in C is a fixed-size collection of similar data items stored in contiguous memory locations. It
                can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, char, float, etc., and also
                derived and user-defined data types such as pointers, structures, etc.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Array Declaration</p>
            <p><br>In C, we have to declare the array like any other variable before using it. We can declare an array
                by
                specifying its name, the type of its elements, and the size of its dimensions. When we declare an array
                in C, the compiler allocates the memory block of the specified size to the array name.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Array Initialization</p>
            <p><br>Initialization in C is the process to assign some initial value to the variable. When the array is
                declared or allocated memory, the elements of the array contain some garbage value. So, we need to
                initialize the array to some meaningful values by using initializer list is the list of values enclosed
                within braces { } separated by a comma.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Accessing</p>
            <p><br>We can access any element of the array by providing the position of the element, called the index.
                Indexes start from 0. We pass the index inside square brackets [] with the name of the array.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Update Array Element</p>
            <p><br>We can update the value of an element at the given index i in a similar way to accessing an element
                by
                using the array square brackets [] and assignment operator (=).</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ C Array Traversal</p>
            <p><br>Traversal is the process in which we visit every element of the data structure. For C array
                traversal, we
                use loops to iterate through each element of the array.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Size of Array</p>
            <p><br>The size of the array refers to the number of elements that can be stored in the array. We can
                extract
                the size using sizeof() operator.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Passing array to Function</p>
            <p><br>In C, arrays are passed to functions using pointers, as the array name decays to a pointer to the
                first
                element. There are three common methods:<br><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unsized array notation, where the array is passed as a pointer without specifying its size.</li>
                <li>Sized array notation, where the size is included in the declaration for clarity, but it’s still
                    passed as a pointer.</li>
                <li>Pointer notation, where the array is explicitly passed as a pointer, often along with its size.</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Multidimensional Array in C</p>
            <p><br>In the above, we only discussed one-dimension array. Multi-dimensional arrays in C are arrays that
                grow
                in multiple directions or dimensions. A one-dimensional array grows linearly, like parallel to the
                X-axis, while in a multi-dimensional array, such as a two-dimensional array, the elements can grow along
                both the X and Y axes.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Two-Dimensional Array in C</p>
            <p><br>A Two-Dimensional array or 2D array in C is an array that has exactly two dimensions. They can be
                visualized in the form of rows and columns organized in a two-dimensional plane.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Three-Dimensional Array in C</p>
            <p><br>Another popular form of a multi-dimensional array is Three-Dimensional Array or 3D Array. A 3D array
                has
                exactly three dimensions. It can be visualized as a collection of 2D arrays stacked on top of each other
                to create the third dimension.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Relationship between Arrays and Pointers</p>
            <p><br>Arrays and Pointers are closely related to each other such that we can use pointers to perform all
                the
                possible operations of the array. The array name is a constant pointer to the first element of the array
                and the array decays to the pointers when passed to the function.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Properties of Arrays in C</p>
            <p><br>It is very important to understand the properties of the C array so that we can avoid bugs while
                using
                it. The following are the main properties of an array in C:<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>The array in C is a fixed-size collection of elements. The size of the array must be known at the
                    compile time, and it cannot be changed once it is declared.</li>
                <li>We can only store one type of element in an array.</li>
                <li>The array index always starts with 0 in C language. It means that the index of the first element of
                    the array will be 0 and the last element will be N – 1.</li>
                <li>All the elements in the array are stored continuously one after another in the memory.</li>
                <li>The array in C provides random access to its element i.e we can get to a random element at any index
                    of the array in constant time complexity just by using its index number.</li>
                <li>There is no index out-of-bounds checking in C.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Array</p>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>A String in C programming is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character ‘\0’. The C String
                is work as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a C string is that the
                string in C is terminated with a unique character ‘\0’.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Declaration</p>
            <p><br>Declaring a string in C is as simple as declaring a one-dimensional array of character type. Below is
                the
                syntax for declaring a string.<br>In the above syntax string_name is any name given to the string
                variable and size is used to define the length of the string, i.e. the number of characters strings will
                store.<br>Like array, we can skip the size in the above statement:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Initialization</p>
            <p><br>We can initialize a string either by specifying the list of characters or string literal.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Accessing</p>
            <p><br>We can access any character of the string by providing the position of the character, like in array.
                We
                pass the index inside square brackets [] with the name of the string.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Update</p>
            <p><br>Updating a character in a string is also possible. We can update any character of a string by using
                the
                index of that character.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ String Length</p>
            <p><br>To find the length of a string, you need to iterate through it until you reach the null character
                (‘\0’).
                The strlen() function from the C standard library is commonly used to get the length of a string.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ String Input</p>
            <p><br>In C, reading a string from the user can be done using different functions, and depending on the use
                case, one method might be chosen over another. Below, the common methods of reading strings in C will be
                discussed, including how to handle whitespace, and concepts will be clarified to better understand how
                string input works.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Using scanf()</p>
            <p><br>The simplest way to read a string in C is by using the scanf() function.<br>There is a limitation
                with
                the scanf() function. scanf() will stop reading input as soon as it encounters a whitespace (space, tab,
                or newline).</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Using scanf() with a Scanset</p>
            <p><br>We can also use scanf() to read strings with spaces by utilizing a scanset. A scanset in scanf()
                allows
                specifying the characters to include or exclude from the input.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Using fgets()</p>
            <p><br>If someone wants to read a complete string, including spaces, they should use the fgets() function.
                Unlike scanf(), fgets() reads the entire line, including spaces, until it encounters a newline.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Passing Strings to Function</p>
            <p><br>As strings are character arrays, we can pass strings to functions in the same way we pass an array to
                a
                function. Below is a sample program to do this: </p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Strings and Pointers in C</p>
            <p><br>Similar to arrays, In C, we can create a character pointer to a string that points to the starting
                address of the string which is the first character of the string. The string can be accessed with the
                help of pointers as shown in the below example.</p>
        </div>



        <div class="box">
            <p style="font-size:25px; ; color: orangered;">⋙ Pointer</p>
            <div class="line"></div>

            <p>A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a direct
                value, it has the address where the value is stored in memory. This allows us to manipulate the data
                stored at a specific memory location without actually using its variable. It is the backbone of
                low-level memory manipulation in C.</p>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Declare a Pointer</p>
            <p><br>A pointer is declared by specifying its name and type, just like simple variable declaration but with
                an
                asterisk (*) symbol added before the pointer’s name.<br> An integer type pointer can only point to an
                integer. Similarly, a pointer of float type can point to a floating-point data, and so on.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Initialize the Pointer</p>
            <p><br>Pointer initialization means assigning some address to the pointer variable. In C, the (&) addressof
                operator is used to get the memory address of any variable. This memory address is then stored in a
                pointer variable.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Dereference a Pointer</p>
            <p><br>Accessing the pointer directly will just give us the address that is stored in the pointer.<br>We
                have to
                first dereference the pointer to access the value present at the memory address. This is done with the
                help of dereferencing operator(*) (same operator used in declaration).</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Size of Pointers</p>
            <p><br>The size of a pointer in C depends on the architecture (bit system) of the machine, not the data type
                it
                points to.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The size of a pointer in C depends on the architecture (bit system) of the machine, not the data
                    type it points to.</li>
                <li>On a 64-bit system, all pointers typically occupy 8 bytes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Special Types of Pointers</p>
            <p><br>There are 4 special types of pointers that used or referred to in different contexts:</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>NULL Pointer</p>
            <p><br>The NULL Pointers are those pointers that do not point to any memory location. They can be created by
                assigning NULL value to the pointer. A pointer of any type can be assigned the NULL value.<br>NULL
                pointers are generally used to represent the absence of any address. This allows us to check whether the
                pointer is pointing to any valid memory location by checking if it is equal to NULL.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Void Pointer</p>
            <p><br>The void pointers in C are the pointers of type void. It means that they do not have any associated
                data
                type. They are also called generic pointers as they can point to any type and can be typecasted to any
                type.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Wild Pointers</p>
            <p><br>The wild pointers are pointers that have not been initialized with something yet. These types of
                C-pointers can cause problems in our programs and can eventually cause them to crash. If values are
                updated using wild pointers, they could cause data abort or data corruption.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 19px; color: aquamarine;"><br><br>Dangling Pointer</p>
            <p><br>A pointer pointing to a memory location that has been deleted (or freed) is called a dangling
                pointer.
                Such a situation can lead to unexpected behavior in the program and also serve as a source of bugs in C
                programs.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ C Pointer Arithmetic</p>
            <p><br>The pointer arithmetic refers to the arithmetic operations that can be performed on a pointer. It is
                slightly different from the ones that we generally use for mathematical calculations as only a limited
                set of operations can be performed on pointers. These operations include:<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Increment/Decrement</li>
                <li>Addition/Subtraction of Integer</li>
                <li>Subtracting Two Pointers of Same Type</li>
                <li>Comparing/Assigning Two Pointers of Same Type</li>
                <li>Comparing/Assigning with NULL</li>
            </ul>


            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ C Pointers and Arrays</p>
            <p><br>In C programming language, pointers and arrays are closely related. An array name acts like a pointer
                constant. The value of this pointer constant is the address of the first element. For example, if we
                have an array named val, then val and &val[0] can be used interchangeably.<br><br>If we assign this
                value to a non-constant pointer to array of the same type, then we can access the elements of the array
                using this pointer. Not only that, as the array elements are stored continuously, we can use pointer
                arithmetic operations such as increment, decrement, addition, and subtraction of integers on pointer to
                move between array elements.<br><br>This concept is not limited to the one-dimensional array, we can
                refer to a multidimensional array element as well using pointers.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Constant Pointers</p>
            <p><br>In constant pointers, the memory address stored inside the pointer is constant and cannot be modified
                once it is defined. It will always point to the same memory address.<br>We can also create a pointer to
                constant or even constant pointer to constant. Refer to this article to know more – Constant pointer,
                Pointers to Constant and Constant Pointers to Constant</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Pointer to Function</p>
            <p><br>A function pointer is a type of pointer that stores the address of a function, allowing functions to
                be
                passed as arguments and invoked dynamically. It is useful in techniques such as callback functions,
                event-driven programs.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Multilevel Pointers</p>
            <p><br>In C, we can create multi-level pointers with any number of levels such as – ***ptr3, ****ptr4,
                ******ptr5 and so on. Most popular of them is double pointer (pointer to pointer). It stores the memory
                address of another pointer. Instead of pointing to a data value, they point to another pointer.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 21px; color:aqua;"><br><br>▣ Uses of Pointers in C</p>
            <p><br>The C pointer is a very powerful tool that is widely used in C programming to perform various useful
                operations. It is used to achieve the following functionalities in C:<br><br></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pass Arguments by Pointers</li>
                <li>Accessing Array Elements</li>
                <li>Return Multiple values from Function</li>
                <li>Dynamic Memory Allocation</li>
                <li>Implementing Data Structures</li>
                <li>In System-Level Programming where memory addresses are useful.</li>
                <li>To use in Control Tables.</li>
